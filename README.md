# Gated Adaptive Network for Cardiac Disease prediction (GAN - CaD)
# 

This project is for the capstone course of my bachelors degree, also known as the "tesina".
It is built using python and flask for the UI, along with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript. The model used for predictions is based of the GANDALF model from PyTorch Tabular. To train this model, data from the Machine Learning Repository of the University of California at Irvine was used.
